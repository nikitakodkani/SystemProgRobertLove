System programming -> Systems software directly talks with kernel and core system libs
Example: Shell, text editor, compiler and debugger, core utilities, system daemons, network and web server and database

Majority of Unix/Linux Code is written at system level in C/C++

Traditional system programming applications: Apache, Bash, cp, emacs, gcc, gdb, glibc, ls, mv, vim 

Major connectors of system programming:
- System calls
- C Lib
- C Compiler
